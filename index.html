Wise launches multi-currency travel card in India as students and
travellers embrace borderless spending</h1>
<p><b>Mumbai, December 18, 2025</b> – <b>Wise</b>
(LON: WISE), the global fintech building the best way to move and
manage money, today announced the launch of the <b>Wise Card</b> in
India – a multi-currency <b>foreign exchange (FX) travel card</b>
that lets Indian customers spend abroad with zero hidden fees and
instant currency conversion. This launch follows a series of
regulatory approvals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that paved
the way for Wise to offer international card services in the
country<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250703-wise-granted-rbi-s-in-principle-approval-to-operate-as-cross-border-payment-aggregator/#:~:text=Mumbai%2C%20June%2003%2C%202025%20%E2%80%93,%E2%80%93%20Cross%20Border%20for%20exports">[1]</a><a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250703-wise-granted-rbi-s-in-principle-approval-to-operate-as-cross-border-payment-aggregator/#:~:text=,3%20business%20days">[2]</a>.
Within weeks of release, the Wise Card has been <b>widely embraced by
students and travellers</b>, indicating a major shift in how Indians
manage money overseas. Over <b>100,000 customers</b> joined the
card’s waitlist ahead of launch, and more than <b>70% have already
completed KYC and received their cards</b>, a conversion rate
significantly higher than industry norms for financial products
(where up to 30% of applicants typically drop off during onboarding).</p>
<h3>Key Highlights</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>High Demand and Quick Adoption:</b> Over
	<b>100k</b> Indians signed up on the Wise Card waitlist; <b>70%</b>
	have completed verification and activation in the first month,
	reflecting seamless digital onboarding. (By comparison, traditional
	forex card issuers often see only ~70% of applicants complete KYC
	due to cumbersome paperwork requirements<a href="https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/pay/cards/forex-cards/multicurrency-platinum-forexplus-chip-card/eligibility#:~:text=%2A%20Self,for%20funding%20the%20Forex%20card">[3]</a>.)</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Students Going Cashless:</b>
	Education-related payments made up <b>75% of Wise’s volume in
	India</b> as of 2024<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/latest-studies/story/indian-students-lose-rs-1700-crore-to-hidden-bank-fees-in-2024-report-2758031-2025-07-20#:~:text=I%20switched%20to%20instant%20platforms%2C,%E2%80%9D">[4]</a>.
	Now thousands of Indian students moving abroad have shifted from
	one-off bank transfers to the Wise Card for daily expenses – using
	it for everything from tuition and rent to coffee, often via Apple
	Pay for the <b>first time</b> in their lives.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Empowering Travellers:</b> International
	travel has surged to <b>53.6% of India’s outward remittances</b>
	(₹1.41 lakh crore, ~$17&nbsp;billion) in FY2023-24<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indians-spend-record-31-7-billion-abroad-in-fy24-17-rise-in-year/articleshow/110314631.cms#:~:text=after%20the%20imposition%20of%20TCS,billion%20in%20the%20previous%20year">[5]</a><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indians-spend-record-31-7-billion-abroad-in-fy24-17-rise-in-year/articleshow/110314631.cms#:~:text=The%20share%20of%20international%20travel,due%20to%20restrictions%20on%20mobility">[6]</a>.
	Wise is targeting this boom: holiday-goers can <b>spend in 160+
	countries at mid-market exchange rates</b> with the Wise Card,
	avoiding the ~3% markup and fees that most credit cards or money
	changers impose<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/latest-studies/story/indian-students-lose-rs-1700-crore-to-hidden-bank-fees-in-2024-report-2758031-2025-07-20#:~:text=Over%2095,3.5%25%20markup%20on%20currency%20exchange">[7]</a><a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250497-singapore-tourism-board-and-wise-to-boost-travel-to-singapore-and-offer-greater-value-for-malaysian-travellers/#:~:text=rates%20and%20hidden%20fees,fees%20as%20high%20as%203">[8]</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Unique Features &amp; Savings:</b> The
	Wise Card supports <b>contactless and mobile payments</b> –
	customers can add it to Apple Pay or Google Pay and tap to pay
	globally – and offers <b>free ATM withdrawals</b> for cash needs
	abroad<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250497-singapore-tourism-board-and-wise-to-boost-travel-to-singapore-and-offer-greater-value-for-malaysian-travellers/#:~:text=hassle">[9]</a>.
	Users can hold <b>40+ currencies</b> in their Wise account and
	convert rupees in-app at real-time rates whenever needed,
	eliminating hidden fees entirely. (A recent Wise-Redseer report
	revealed Indian students lost <b>₹1,700 crore</b> in hidden bank
	charges in 2024 alone<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/latest-studies/story/indian-students-lose-rs-1700-crore-to-hidden-bank-fees-in-2024-report-2758031-2025-07-20#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20Indian%20families%20collectively,to%20hidden%20charges%20from%20banks">[10]</a>
	– a cost Wise seeks to eliminate for Indian consumers.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>
Riding on Wise’s Momentum and Licences in India</h2>
<p>This product launch builds on <b>Wise’s
accelerating momentum in India</b> over the past two years. Wise
first entered the Indian market in 2021 and has since grown rapidly
by offering faster, cheaper international transfers. Today, Wise
powers around <b>10% of all remittances sent into India</b><a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250703-wise-granted-rbi-s-in-principle-approval-to-operate-as-cross-border-payment-aggregator/#:~:text=This%20milestone%20builds%20on%20Wise%27s,on%20its%20local%20presence%20through">[11]</a>
and operates on its own Authorised Dealer Category II (AD-II) licence
to facilitate outward remittances at low cost. For example, sending
₹1&nbsp;lakh abroad via Wise costs roughly <b>1.5%</b> in fees on
average, with <b>70% of transfers delivered in under 12 hours</b> –
far quicker than the 2–3 day industry standard<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250703-wise-granted-rbi-s-in-principle-approval-to-operate-as-cross-border-payment-aggregator/#:~:text=,3%20business%20days">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Wise also became one of the first fintechs to
secure the RBI’s <b>in-principle approval as a Payment Aggregator
(Cross-Border)</b><a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250703-wise-granted-rbi-s-in-principle-approval-to-operate-as-cross-border-payment-aggregator/#:~:text=Mumbai%2C%20June%2003%2C%202025%20%E2%80%93,%E2%80%93%20Cross%20Border%20for%20exports">[1]</a>
for export payments, opening the door to new services. The <b>Wise
Card</b> leverages these regulatory milestones to bring Indian
customers a seamless way to <i>spend</i> money internationally,
complementing Wise’s existing send-and-receive offerings. <b>Smrithi
Ravi, Wise’s APAC Head of Engineering</b>, notes that the company’s
expanded India hub in Hyderabad has been key to localizing such
products: <i>“Our engineering teams in India have been building
features specifically tailored to Indian customers’ needs.
Launching the Wise Card here was a natural next step – we had the
tech and licenses in place, and a clear demand from users.”</i></p>
<p>Notably, Wise has <b>streamlined the traditionally cumbersome KYC
process</b> for issuing an FX card. Unlike legacy banks that require
stacks of physical documents – from passport and PAN copies to visa
and bank statements – and manual verification<a href="https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/pay/cards/forex-cards/multicurrency-platinum-forexplus-chip-card/eligibility#:~:text=%2A%20Self,for%20funding%20the%20Forex%20card">[3]</a>,
Wise’s onboarding is 100% digital. Most users complete verification
from their smartphone in minutes via video KYC and secure document
uploads. <i>“I was amazed that I didn’t have to visit a branch or
mail any papers. I signed up for the Wise Card from my couch and got
verified the same day,”</i> says <b>Rohan Mehta</b>, a 19-year-old
from Mumbai headed to study in the UK.</p>
<h2>
Students Embrace a Cashless, Card-first Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Indian students abroad have been early
adopters of the Wise Card. Having already used Wise to pay tuition
and rent internationally, many are now using the card for day-to-day
spending rather than dealing with large wire transfers or carrying
cash. In fact, <b>three out of four Wise customers who sent money for
education have also opted for the card</b> (an attach rate of ~75%).
They benefit from <b>mid-market FX rates with no markup</b> and
instant access to money, which is a stark change from the past.</p>
<p>“<i>Back when I first went abroad, my parents would do a bank
transfer for my big expenses, and I’d carry some cash for small
purchases. I never imagined I’d be</i> <i>tapping my phone to pay</i>
<i>for a meal in London,”</i> admits <b>Rohan Mehta</b>, now a
student at King’s College. <i>“With Wise, I just use Apple Pay
everywhere – from the Tube to groceries – and it pulls from my
rupee balance at the real rate. It’s seamless, and my family saves
on fees. This is something</i> <i>I’d never experienced before,
coming from India.”</i></p>
<p>His sentiment is echoed by others who have switched. Instead of
juggling forex demand drafts, multiple bank accounts, or expensive
campus cards, students are managing all their finances through the
Wise app and card. <b>Wise’s internal data</b> shows that on
average, new student users make <b>8+ transactions per week</b> with
the card, pointing to regular use for groceries, restaurants, and
subscriptions like Spotify and Netflix. This marks a shift from a
one-off remittance mindset to a <b>continuous, cashless spending
habit</b> – a change powered by convenience and transparency.
<i>“Students today move fast; their money should too. Five-day
waits and surprise charges don’t fit their lifestyle,”</i> says
<b>Taneia Bhardwaj, South Asia Expansion Lead at Wise</b>,
highlighting that young Indians expect digital solutions abroad just
as they do at home<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/latest-studies/story/indian-students-lose-rs-1700-crore-to-hidden-bank-fees-in-2024-report-2758031-2025-07-20#:~:text=THE%20ISSUE%20OF%20TRUST%20AND,TRANSPARENCY">[13]</a>.</p>
<h2>
Making Travel Easier for India’s Global Explorers</h2>
<p>Beyond the student community, Wise is
actively courting <b>India’s booming outbound travellers</b>. The
timing is opportune: pent-up demand after the pandemic led Indians to
spend a record <b>$31.7&nbsp;billion overseas in FY2023-24</b>, with
<b>travel</b> alone accounting for $17&nbsp;billion (₹1.4&nbsp;lakh
crore) – <b>53.6% of all outward remittances under
LRS</b><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indians-spend-record-31-7-billion-abroad-in-fy24-17-rise-in-year/articleshow/110314631.cms#:~:text=after%20the%20imposition%20of%20TCS,billion%20in%20the%20previous%20year">[5]</a>.
This surge in international tourism has outpaced even education
payments, creating a new priority segment for fintech innovation.
Wise’s strategy is to become the go-to travel card for this wave of
tourists and business travellers, capitalizing on the pain points of
traditional options.</p>
<p>Many Indian travellers currently rely on <b>bank-issued forex
cards or credit cards</b> abroad, often unaware of the true costs.
According to a recent survey, 67% of travellers know their banks
charge hidden exchange markups (often <b>3%+ per transaction</b>) and
foreign usage fees, yet 65% still use those cards out of habit<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250497-singapore-tourism-board-and-wise-to-boost-travel-to-singapore-and-offer-greater-value-for-malaysian-travellers/#:~:text=rates%20and%20hidden%20fees,fees%20as%20high%20as%203">[8]</a>.
Others queue up at airport money changers, losing 5-10% in poor
rates<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250497-singapore-tourism-board-and-wise-to-boost-travel-to-singapore-and-offer-greater-value-for-malaysian-travellers/#:~:text=rates%20and%20hidden%20fees,fees%20as%20high%20as%203">[8]</a>.
The Wise Card squarely addresses these inefficiencies. By using the
<b>mid-market exchange rate</b> (the same rate one finds on Google)
and charging no foreign transaction fees, it guarantees <b>huge
savings</b> for travellers. For instance, someone spending ₹2&nbsp;lakh
on a Europe trip could easily save over ₹6,000 in fees compared to
using a typical credit card (which would silently add ~3.5% in FX

<p>Additionally, <b>Wise has partnered with Atlys</b>, a popular
digital visa application platform, to reach travellers at the start
of their journey. Starting this October, <b>Atlys users applying for
visas</b> to the US, UK, Schengen and other destinations have been
receiving an invite to get a Wise Card as part of their pre-travel
checklist. <i>“We strive to make every aspect of travel simpler for
our users,”</i> says <b>Mohak Nahta, Founder &amp; CEO of Atlys</b>.
<i>“By offering the Wise Card during the visa process, we’re
solving the foreign currency puzzle upfront. Travelers love landing
in a new country already equipped with a card that works everywhere
and</i> <i>saves them money.”</i> Thousands of applicants have
already taken up this offer, activating their Wise Cards before
departure. This integration has not only added convenience for
travellers but also given Wise a strong foothold among first-time
overseas tourists who might not have considered a fintech solution
for spending.</p>
<p><b>Neha Gupta, 34,</b> an avid traveller from New Delhi, was one
such convert. She recalls how on a recent trip to Japan she found
many places preferred cash: <i>“Even with an HDFC Infinia credit
card in my wallet (which is great for airline miles), I struggled
when I needed cash. My bank would charge ₹500 plus 2% for an ATM
withdrawal abroad – daylight robbery! So I tried Wise. With</i>
<i>zero ATM fees, it was a lifesaver in Tokyo. I could withdraw yen
at ATMs with</i> <i>no extra charges, and the exchange rate was
unbelievably good. Now I carry my Wise Card on every trip for backup,
especially in countries like</i> <i>Japan and Germany</i> <i>where
cash is king.”</i></p>
<p>Neha’s experience underscores a key differentiator: the Wise
Card offers <b>two fee-free ATM withdrawals each month</b> (up to a
fair usage limit) for all customers<a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250497-singapore-tourism-board-and-wise-to-boost-travel-to-singapore-and-offer-greater-value-for-malaysian-travellers/#:~:text=hassle">[9]</a>.
This feature has resonated strongly with frequent flyers and travel
bloggers, who often warn of the steep surcharges banks levy for cash
withdrawals overseas. By essentially eliminating ATM fees for
moderate use, Wise ensures travellers can access local currency when
needed – whether it’s euros for a Munich Christmas market or yen
for a taxi in rural Japan – without dread of fees. <i>“Having
Wise in my pocket means I never worry about finding an exchange
counter or paying 5% extra on my credit card. It’s peace of mind,”</i>
Neha adds.</p>
<h2>
Wise’s Vision – A Borderless Money Experience for All Indians</h2>
<p>With the Indian launch of its card, Wise
is <b>ambitious about scaling up</b>. The company is already planning
to support <b>500,000 Indian cardholders by the end of 2026</b>,
aiming to capture a significant share of the outward travel spend
market. <i>“Our mission is to create a world where moving money is
completely transparent, instant, and free of friction,”</i> said
<b>Shrawan (SK) Saraogi, APAC Head of Expansion at Wise</b>. <i>“Over
the last decade, we’ve solved cross-border transfers for millions
of people. Now we’re tackling everyday spending.</i> <i>Indians
spent over $30&nbsp;billion abroad last year</i> <i>– too much of
that went to bank fees and bad exchange rates. The Wise Card is our
answer:</i> <i>a faster, cheaper, and more transparent way</i> <i>for
Indians to spend their money globally,”</i> he explained<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/latest-studies/story/indian-students-lose-rs-1700-crore-to-hidden-bank-fees-in-2024-report-2758031-2025-07-20#:~:text=Over%2095,3.5%25%20markup%20on%20currency%20exchange">[7]</a><a href="https://newsroom.wise.com/en-CAS/250497-singapore-tourism-board-and-wise-to-boost-travel-to-singapore-and-offer-greater-value-for-malaysian-travellers/#:~:text=rates%20and%20hidden%20fees,fees%20as%20high%20as%203">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>Saraogi noted that the early reception has exceeded expectations,
reflecting a strong pent-up demand. <i>“Frankly, the uptake has
been incredible. It shows that people were waiting for something like
this. In the first month, we’ve seen tens of thousands of
transactions via Wise Cards from India – from California coffee
shops to European rail tickets – and growth is primarily through
word-of-mouth. We’re confident that by next year, a Wise Card will
be as essential in an Indian traveller’s wallet as their passport,”</i>
he added. Wise also hinted at upcoming features for Indian users,
such as <b>UPI integration for easier rupee top-ups</b> and
partnerships with travel agencies to bundle the card with tour
packages, further simplifying the customer experience.</p>
